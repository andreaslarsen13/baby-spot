### CRITERION COLLECTION

**Source:** Criterion essay on Béla Tarr's "The Turin Horse"
**Voice:** The Intellectual Curator — cinematic, atmospheric, historically grounded

"The Turin Horse opens with a cheeky epigraph about Friedrich Nietzsche, whose encounter with a beaten horse famously preceded his mental collapse: 'We do not know what happened to the horse.' Viewers are then thrown into a furious run across the Great Hungarian Plain as the horse pulls a coach, a man cracking his whip. The wind is raging, dead leaves scattering, strands of fog wisping through the frame."

"The Nietzsche anecdote aside, the movie unfolds with the patience and gravity of scripture. An hour passes before there is dialogue worth mentioning. When at last the pair break silence, the old man speaks of how the world has been 'debased' and 'acquired.' And that's it."

"Béla Tarr, who after thirty-four years and nine features has said this will be his final film, has a career-long fascination with society's most destitute, their life of quiet, unremitting desperation."

### GRAND SEIKO

**Source:** Grand Seiko "Nature of Time" Philosophy
**Voice:** The Spiritual Engineer — meditative, precise, nature-rooted

"THE NATURE OF TIME is Grand Seiko's brand philosophy. The brand celebrates the Japanese spirituality of time that is deeply inspired by nature. Whether it be the enchantment of a flowing river, the quietness that falls with snow, or the stillness within the rush of a waterfall, we have a special sensitivity to all the textures of time that nature offers."

"Spring Drive is inspired by a philosophy that is unique to Grand Seiko. The Seiko founder, Kintaro Hattori, once defined his vision for his company as 'always one step ahead of the rest.' For Spring Drive, that step was to fuse the traditional skill of mechanical watchmaking with the high accuracy of electronic regulation in a way that only a company with Seiko's breadth of skills and depth of craft knowledge could conceive."

**Source:** Grand Seiko Shizukuishi Watch Studio
**Voice:** Place as philosophy, craft as ritual

"Nestled in the tranquil forests of Shizukuishi, Iwate Prefecture, the studio is surrounded by nature. Here, every 9S movement is infused with the spirit of the master watchmakers. Visitors can see first-hand the extraordinary care and concentration of the craftsmen and women as they assemble and adjust the 9S movements. The tradition of this building, and those who work within it, is honoured every time a new Grand Seiko watch is completed, when the watch is brought to life and begins to mark the passage of time."

### PORSCHE

**Source:** Porsche Newsroom — Taycan Exterior Design
**Voice:** The German Functionalist — declarative, technical, purposeful

"The result is an emotionally charged, four-door sports saloon that carries the unmistakable Porsche design DNA. Its silhouette is defined by the sporty roofline sloping downward to the rear — called a 'flyline' by the Porsche designers."

"The highly sculpted body has a distinctly muscular and athletic look. This defines the shoulders in the rear, which are so typical of Porsche and are clearly reminiscent of the design icon, the 911."

"The black panel on the rear has an innovative, three-dimensional design and extends across the entire vehicle width, interrupted only by the 'PORSCHE' lettering. This creates a generous glass appearance for the rear window. Together with the slim LED light strip, it constitutes the characteristic night design of the first electric sports car from Porsche."

### HERMÈS

**Source:** Hermès — Six Generations of Artisans
**Voice:** The Artisan Poet — historical, tactile, rooted in material and lineage

"Since 1837, generation after generation, Hermès has followed a dual thread — on the one hand the painstaking work of the craftsman in his workshop, and on the other the lifestyles of its customers. Carried by an enduring spirit of freedom and creativity, Hermès remains highly sensitive and attentive to the changing nature and needs of society."

"The adventure began in Paris in 1837 when the harness-maker Thierry Hermès opened a workshop in rue Basse-du-Rempart. From the beginning, he understood and anticipated his customers' expectations, their desire for simplicity and lightness in a city teeming with modern movement. His harnesses embodied discreet finesse as well as endurance in all conditions: a technical achievement that was recognized with an award at the Universal Exhibition of 1867."

"During the interwar period, lifestyles changed and the house broke new ground under the management of Émile Hermès, son of Charles-Émile. Hermès offered items that met society's needs, from saddlery and harnesses to leather goods. Émile Hermès had been inspired by a very simple idea that decisively changed the course of the family business. During a trip to Canada, he was fascinated by the American 'close-all' opening and closing system on the hood of a military car. In 1922, he obtained the exclusive rights to this system, known today as the zip or zipper; and it came to be used on many of the house's bags."

"The petit h workshop was created under the leadership of Pascale Mussard, niece of Jean-Louis Dumas, and adopts a unique approach within the house, that of creation in reverse. Starting with unused materials from Hermès manufactures, artisans and designers give free rein to their inventiveness to create unique and unexpected objects, building on the exceptional know-how of the house."

"In keeping with the artisanal and humanist values of the family company, the foundation works mainly in the fields of creation, the transmission of know-how, the preservation of the planet and solidarity through its own support programmes, both in France and abroad. Though diverse, the activity of the Foundation is motivated by a single conviction: what we do creates who we are."

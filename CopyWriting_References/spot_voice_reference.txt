### VITRA
**Target Tone: Industrial Narrative**
Sentences that connect physical form to functional purpose.

**Magazine Introduction:**
"The Vitra Magazine features an assortment of articles, images, interviews and anecdotes. It revolves around the themes of design, architecture and culture, our products and their authors, exhibitions and past events — here you can experience the many facets of Project Vitra."

**Tea Ceremony at the Eames House:**
"Charles and Ray Eames were endlessly curious — about people, cultures, traditions and the many ways of living and creating. Their home in Pacific Palisades was not only a place of work and play but also a stage for encounters that blended art, friendship and cultural exchange. One such occasion was when the Eames House became the setting for a Japanese tea ceremony that beautifully expressed their openness to learning from others as well as their fascination with Japanese aesthetics.

In 1951 Charles and Ray Eames invited Isamu Noguchi and the actress Yoshiko 'Shirley' Yamaguchi. The guests included other remarkable figures such as Charlie Chaplin, avant-garde poet Iris Tree and actor Ford Rainey. The Japanese tea was served on the Eameses' low-set Occasional Table LTR while Noguchi's Akari Light Sculptures softly illuminated the living room."

**Lounge Chairs Collection:**
"The portfolio of Vitra armchairs and lounge chairs ranges from legendary design classics to contemporary creations, from small versions to expansive models, from compact unupholstered armchairs to soft lounge chairs engineered for ultimate comfort. This makes them as diverse as the people who use them."

### AESOP
**Target Tone: Clinical but Warm**
Measured, complete sentences regarding efficacy and sensory detail.

### MOMA (MUSEUM OF MODERN ART)
**Target Tone: Objective Observation**
High-level summaries of artistic themes without marketing fluff.

**Collection Galleries:**
"Arranged in loosely chronological order, each of the presentations on this floor explores an individual topic. A room may be devoted to an artist, a specific medium or discipline, a particular place in a moment in time, or a shared creative idea. An ongoing program of frequent reinstallation will feature a wide range of artworks in new combinations — a reminder that countless ideas and histories can be explored through the Museum's dynamic collection."

**Architecture and Design Department:**
"The world's first curatorial department devoted to architecture and design was established in 1932 at The Museum of Modern Art. From its inception, the collection has been built on the recognition that architecture and design are allied and interdependent arts, so that synthesis has been a founding premise of the collection. Including 28,000 works ranging from large-scale design objects to works on paper and architectural models, the Museum's diverse Architecture and Design collection surveys major figures and movements from the mid-19th century to the present.

Starting with the reform ideology established by the Arts and Crafts movement, the collection covers major movements of the 20th century and contemporary issues. The architecture collection documents buildings through models, drawings, and photographs."

### KINFOLK
**Target Tone: The Sophisticated Observer**
Thoughtful editorial prose about design, architecture, or lifestyle.

**Designated Drudgery (Ana Kinsella):**
"You can't quite see the mental load the way you can see a pile of laundry or an armful of groceries, but that's part of the problem. Underpinning every household is a wealth of activity and thought that runs just beneath the surface, keeping everything from breaking down into chaos. What's in the fridge? Whose birthday is coming up next? How long have those dishes been there? The mental load is the endless to-do list of tasks and data that looms in the mind, a complex network of responsibilities that allows us to get anything done in the first place."

## GOLDEN SNIPPETS: DEEPER VOICE REFERENCES

### THE MANIFESTO
*Space, silence, order — philosophy as prose*

**Dieter Rams (via Vitsœ):**
"Back in the late 1970s, Dieter Rams was becoming increasingly concerned by the state of the world around him: 'An impenetrable confusion of forms, colours and noises.' Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself an important question: is my design good design?"

"I imagine our current situation will cause future generations to shudder at the thoughtlessness in the way in which we today fill our homes, our cities and our landscape with a chaos of assorted junk."

"Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity."

**Peter Zumthor:**
"Presence is like a gap in the flow of history, where all of sudden it is not past and not future."

"I look at a tree and the tree doesn't tell me anything. The tree does not have a message; The tree does not want to sell me something. The tree won't say to me — 'look at me, I am so beautiful, I am more beautiful than the other trees.' It's just a tree — and it's beautiful. Nothing special — incredibly powerful."

"When I look at this kind of house without a form, what interests me the most is emotional space. If a space doesn't get to me, then I am not interested. I want to create emotional spaces which get to you."

"There is something bigger in the world than you are."

**John Pawson:**
"The narrative of some projects unexpectedly stretches over many years. The intention may be unfaltering and the architectural vision clear, but a concatenation of circumstances slows the process."

### THE EDITOR'S LETTER
*Detached, sophisticated observation*

**Apartamento (Thea McLachlan on Celia Paul):**
"This corner holds the stillness of absence/presence in a way that's difficult to describe and affects the paintings I'm doing now — not in any obvious way — but just the memory of their dedication to sitting is empowering."

"Now, I don't fear interruptions as if they might be the end of the world, like I used to when I had to fight for my time alone in my studio."

"I have always been, and I remain at nearly sixty, the same person I was as a teenager. This simple realisation seems to me to be profoundly liberating."

**The Gentlewoman (Holly Brubach on Agnès Varda):**
"Agnès keeps her Oscar in the kitchen, on the counter, in a spot that might otherwise be occupied by a bowl of fruit or a toaster. The kitchen, Agnès told an interviewer in 2002, 15 years before the Oscar came her way, is 'a very female realm. I'm not saying that we're all cooks or cleaning women, but we women feel comfortable in the kitchen.'"

"When her hands changed, she told her grandchildren, 'Look, it's a landscape,' with veins as rivers and knuckles as mountains. 'The question is how it looks. I don't have the feeling that it's ugly.'"

"When you make fiction, you want an actor to do this or that. You are the master of your story. But when you do a documentary, the subject is more important than your position as the director. You are at the service of the subject — you're not the big person. The form obliges you to modesty."

**Cereal (Robert Wood on Broome):**
"The pale blue ocean stretches as far as the eye can see, and the waves lap over and over again on the white sand shore. The beach is edged by deep red dirt — 'pindan dust' they call it — and this is where the desert meets the sea along a coastline as long as forever."

"The rhythm of 'Broome time' lulls one into an embracing warmth that opens up the soul."

"There are always young people — lithe and tanned and supple, feeling carefree no matter what the future holds. Playing ball games on Cable Beach as camels pass by, dancing and arcing and bending in the long days, becoming lovers and loved, wandering into the blue, stroking the water and making themselves belong."

### THE PROCESS
*Materials, production, craftsmanship*

**Margaret Howell:**
"I think of myself as a hands-on designer. For me make is integral to my design philosophy. It is crucial how a piece of clothing feels when worn. I've always wanted clothes to be the way I drew them — relaxed and lived in, a natural look."

"I'm inspired by the authenticity I can find in nature, people and places, and I think it is the same quality I look for in the materials I choose. For example, the feel of hand-woven Harris tweed and the irregular slub of Irish linen. I feel passionate about landscape, and its connection with such fabrics and the skilled people who weave them."

"I like to work with manufacturers who understand and share this passion for make and quality of fabric: specialists such as Mackintosh and their part hand-made raincoats, and the Scottish knitting factories that continue their heritage of producing the best cashmere in the world."

"In 1970 I was encouraged by finding — at a jumble sale — an old, yet finely stitched pinstripe shirt. Today I still find it exciting to hunt out objects I consider to be well-made and enduring."

**The Row:**
"Focusing on exceptional fabrics, impeccable details, and precise tailoring, the house combines a timeless perspective with subtle attitudes which form an irreverent classic signature. The Row's collections also explore the strength of simplistic shapes that speak to discretion and are based on uncompromising quality."
